## Short description

### What's the problem?
**Climate change is one of the major challenges of the 21st century**. Introducing further **unpredictability in food security**, directly impacting the performance of various seeds for the next growing seasons, making our **farmersâ€™ crops decision even riskier**.

To remain sustainable, **farming must adapt quickly** to the changing conditions of our world.

### How can technology help?
**Leveraging AI and model training**, we believe we can - all together - provide many solutions for a **more resilient local agriculture**, leading through a **global improvement of food security**.

### The idea
ESSPERA was imagined to response to the big issue of food security from its roots. 
The idea is to **provide farmers the best seed recommendation**, thanks to farmers associations and governmental **seed trials results**. 

Helping them to make better decision with confidence to grow more resilient, we **ensure a better local food security**.

## The architecture
### Test/Dev Architecture (Existing):
![ESSPERA Solution Architecture_existing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65171375/198745641-5ad19c36-a26d-401a-a352-2abd926fe616.png)
1. Web application: farmers can access their dashboard to get seed recommendation based on their location
2. ESSPERA database: storing mapping between model/deployment and crop type
3. Exposed API: exposing deployed prediction model as API
4. Deployment: deploy trained models and created callable APIs to do prediction
5. IBM Watson Studio: manage CP4D as a Service assets; Store data assets and model required when running Jupyter notebooks
6. IBM Watson Machine Learning: used by deployment to get the prediction of seed yield
7. Cloud Object Storage: used by CP4D as a Service to store model and CSVs
8. Jupyter Notebooks: Clean CSVs, amend with weather data and soil type; Train models to deploy
9. IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite: get historical and forecast weather data

### Production Architecture (Future):

## Long description
Climate change is putting constant pressure on agricultural productivity, threatening decades of global progress in improving food security. It is a complex problem that can only be tackled through a combinations of incremental improvement. But broadly speaking, in the words of the IMF:

"Investing in climate-resilient agriculture will be vital to increasing future harvests. More intense and more unpredictable climatic events are increasing food insecurity. Low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa , are among the least prepared to face the effects of climate change. Solutions should be tailored to country circumstances, with a focus on low-cost, high-impact measures, such as investing in new crop varieties, improving water management, and information dissemination."

Esspera came about out of our desire to contribute such a low-cost, high-impact solution to this fight. During our research, we discovered the extent of the large-scale efforts currently underway to rapidly develop productive cultivars adapted to rapidly changing global and local climatic conditions. We observed the extensive germplasm data that is being made publicly available through organisations like the CIMMYT, and the large number of promising varieties that are developed and commercialized every year. But while researchers can currently use open source tools to predict fairly accurately the productivity in a given environment of the genetics of two germplasm when creating a new hybrid, no such tool exists to allow a farmer to compare how commercially available variants would perform in his local climatic conditions.

Typically, large scale fields trials are conducted at the regional level through the cooperative efforts of farmer associations, universities, seed growers, governmental agencies, and others. These regional consortiums or organisations typically conduct performance trials for hundreds of varieties in multiples test sites, to account for varying local environmental conditions. They tend to publish their results for free, but usually in a PDF format.

## Getting started
### Pre-requisites
1. [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com) with these services:
    1. [Cloud Object Storage - Lite plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create)
    2. [Watson Studio - Lite plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio)
    3. [Watson Machine Learning - Lite plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning)
    4. [Db2 - Lite plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2)
2. In CP4D as a Service, [create a new project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/projects.html)
3. In CP4D as a Service, [create a new deployment space](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-space-create.html)
